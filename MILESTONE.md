## 🛡️ Executive Strategic Summary

Uncapped free cloud compute is an existential trap. While Cloudflare R2 eliminates data egress fees, high-frequency Class A operations, Redis connection counts, and heavy image rasterization compute on Go daemons represent compounding variable costs that grow linearly with unmonetized traffic.

Simultaneously, traditional programmatic SEO (`/[tool]` doorway directories) triggers severe penalties under Google’s Search Updates (targeting scaled doorway pages and unoriginal programmatic content).

This milestone plan executes a decisive two-pronged pivot:
1. **Economic Inversion:** Transitioning 80–85% of traffic to client-side WebAssembly (`pdf-lib` / canvas), reducing cloud compute to a high-intent, rate-limited premium fallback.
2. **Intent-Driven Product Wedge:** Escaping commoditized "convert jpg" keyword wars by capturing high-intent utility searches like *"JPG to PDF under 200KB for government portals"* with targeted compression heuristics.

## 📦 Milestone 1: Economic Sustainability & Abuse Defense (v1.1)
**Goal:** Prevent cloud bill collapse by defaulting to client-side compute and enforcing strict edge defense.

### Issue #1: Implement Default Client-Side WASM Engine
- **Priority:** `P0 - CRITICAL`
- **Labels:** `enhancement`, `priority-critical`, `economics`
- **Scope & Approach:**
  - Standardize `pdf-lib` / WebAssembly conversion natively inside the user's browser.
  - Implement dynamic routing in frontend: All jobs with $\le 20$ images and total payload $\le 50\text{ MB}$ compile entirely on client hardware ($0 server cost).
  - Only route to the Go backend worker when job size $> 50\text{ MB}$, batch $> 20$ files, or when the user explicitly requests OCR or server compression.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Frontend automatically classifies payload and switches between WASM and Cloud engines.
  - [ ] WASM output passes visual parity checks against `pdfcpu` generated PDFs.
  - [ ] Clear UI status badge appears: *"⚡ Processed 100% locally on your device (Private & Instant)"*.
  - [ ] Anonymous telemetry tracks ratio of client vs cloud conversions (Target: $\ge 85\%$ client-side).

### Issue #2: Edge Rate Limiting & Bot Scrubbing
- **Priority:** `P0 - CRITICAL`
- **Labels:** `security`, `priority-critical`, `infrastructure`
- **Scope & Approach:**
  - Enforce Upstash Redis sliding-window rate limiters at the NestJS gateway.
  - Mitigate headless scraping bots that exploit conversion workers as free image compute.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Limit free IP usage to 100 conversions / hour.
  - [ ] Integrate Cloudflare Turnstile / CAPTCHA challenge after 10 requests within a 5-minute burst.
  - [ ] Block known automated headless agents (Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium signatures).
  - [ ] Expose health and quota headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`).

### Issue #3: Multi-Tiered Cloud Quotas & Upgrade Triggers
- **Priority:** `P1 - HIGH`
- **Labels:** `monetization`, `backend`, `priority-high`
- **Scope & Approach:**
  - Bound server-side conversion access while keeping local browser conversion unconditionally unlimited.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Unauthenticated / Free Tier capped at 20 cloud conversions per rolling 24 hours.
  - [ ] Client-side WASM conversions remain permanently unlimited and unthrottled.
  - [ ] Inline banner displays quota consumption: *"14 of 20 cloud conversions remaining today"*.
  - [ ] Graceful upgrade modal prompts when cloud limits are exceeded.

  - Implement a dedicated preset engine: *"Target Under 100KB"*, *"Under 200KB"*, *"Under 500KB"*, *"Under 1MB"*, *"Under 2MB"*.
  - Worker executes binary search algorithm iterating between JPEG quality levels ($85 \to 40$) and DPI downscaling ($300 \to 150 \to 72$) to hit the byte threshold within $\le 3$ passes.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] UI provides quick-select chips for government/portal standard thresholds (200KB, 500KB, 1MB).
  - [ ] Output PDF size guarantees $\pm 8\%$ accuracy of chosen threshold.
  - [ ] UI warns if original image text resolution would fall below legibility minimums.
  - [ ] Live preview updates estimated resulting file size before download.

### Issue #5: "Document Scanner" Enhancement Filter
- **Priority:** `P2 - MEDIUM`
- **Labels:** `enhancement`, `ux`, `canvas`
- **Scope & Approach:**
  - Provide a 1-click preset that turns crumpled, shadowed, off-white smartphone photos of paper documents into crisp, scanner-quality monochrome or high-contrast prints.
  - Implemented via HTML5 Canvas shaders client-side (or `govips` matrix pipeline).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] One-click toggle: *"Document Mode (Whitening & Deskew)"*.
  - [ ] Automatic shadow removal, background whitening, and gamma compensation ($1.3 - 1.5$).
  - [ ] Processing latency overhead remains below $400\text{ ms}$ on client hardware.
  - [ ] Split-screen slider comparing Original vs Enhanced document.

  - [ ] Popup queue tray managing image reordering and 1-click compile.
  - [ ] Uses local WASM compilation without routing image data through external APIs.

### Issue #8: Open-Source Core SDK (`@jpgtopdf/core`)
- **Priority:** `P2 - MEDIUM`
- **Labels:** `open-source`, `npm`, `developer-relations`
- **Scope & Approach:**
  - Package the client-side conversion logic as an independent zero-dependency TypeScript package published on NPM.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Standalone NPM package with zero bloat and full TypeScript type definitions.
  - [ ] Supports both browser (`HTMLImageElement`, `Blob`) and Node.js environments.

## 🤖 Continuous 24-Hour Automated Bug Hunter Pipeline

KrocPDF runs an automated daily health check via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/daily-audit.yml`):
- **Schedule**: Every 24 hours at `00:00 UTC` + manual dispatch.
- **Automated Verification**:
  1. Frontend TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`), ESLint, and Vitest test suites.
  2. Backend NestJS TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`), Oxlint, and Vitest test suites.
  3. Worker Go verification (`go vet ./...`, `go test -v ./...`).
  4. Dependency vulnerability security audits (`npm audit`).
- **Autonomous Issue Creation**:
  If any check fails, the pipeline autonomously creates a detailed GitHub issue labeled `automated-audit`, `type: bug`, `priority: high` containing failure logs, commit ref, and local reproduction steps (with built-in deduplication to avoid duplicate tickets).
