# 🤝 Contributing to JPG to PDF Platform

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **JPG to PDF Platform**! We are building an enterprise-grade, privacy-first, and high-throughput alternative to ad-cluttered and predatory PDF converters. 

Whether you're fixing a typo in documentation, squashing a race condition in the Go worker daemon, optimizing canvas memory in Next.js, or implementing binary search compression, your contributions are welcome and deeply valued.

## 🧭 How Can I Contribute?

### Finding an Issue
If you are new to the codebase, check out:
- **[`good first issue`](https://github.com/alokprashar864/jpg_to_pdf/labels/good%20first%20issue)**: Beginner-friendly issues (UI tweaks, documentation updates, helper functions).
- **[`help wanted`](https://github.com/alokprashar864/jpg_to_pdf/labels/help%20wanted)**: High-impact features or technical challenges open for community collaboration.

> 💡 **Tip:** Before writing code, please comment on an open issue to express your interest so other contributors don't duplicate your work. If an issue doesn't exist for what you want to build, open an issue first!

### Suggesting Features
Have an idea for a compression preset, UI improvement, or distribution channel? Please open a **Feature Request** using our [Issue Form](https://github.com/alokprashar864/jpg_to_pdf/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) to discuss technical viability with maintainers.

### Reporting Bugs
If you encounter unexpected errors or conversion failures:
1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/alokprashar864/jpg_to_pdf/issues) to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a **Bug Report** using our [Bug Report Form](https://github.com/alokprashar864/jpg_to_pdf/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml). Include browser details, steps to reproduce, and console or worker log outputs.

## 🛠 Local Development Environment

Our repository is organized as a lightweight, clean monorepo:
- `frontend/`: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, WebAssembly canvas engine.
- `backend-api/`: NestJS, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, Redis Streams orchestrator.
- `worker-service/`: Go daemon utilizing `pdfcpu` and `govips` for parallel compilation.

### Prerequisites
Ensure your local machine has the following installed:
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (v24.x or later)
- **Node.js** (v20.x or later) and `npm`
- **Go** (v1.21 or later)
- **Git**

---

### 1. Booting Local Infrastructure (Docker)
We use Docker Compose to spin up local instances of PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO (an S3-compatible local bucket pre-configured with lifecycle rules and CORS policies):

```bash
# 1. Clone repository and copy environment defaults
git clone https://github.com/alokprashar864/jpg_to_pdf.git
cd jpg_to_pdf
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO S3
docker compose up -d
```

Verify that all three containers are healthy:
```bash
docker compose ps
```
- **PostgreSQL:** `localhost:5432`
- **Redis:** `localhost:6379`
- **MinIO S3 API:** `localhost:9000`
- **MinIO Web Console:** `http://localhost:9001` (User: `admin`, Password: `admin123`)

---

### 2. Backend API Gateway (NestJS + Prisma)
The API gateway manages presigned upload URLs, database records, and enqueues jobs to Redis Streams.

```bash
cd backend-api
npm install

# Push database schema to PostgreSQL
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# Start development server with hot-reload
npm run start:dev
```
*The API gateway will be active on `http://localhost:3000`.*

---

### 3. Conversion Worker Daemon (Go)
The Go worker consumes conversion jobs from Redis Streams, streams images from MinIO/R2, and compiles lossless PDFs using native goroutines.

```bash
cd ../worker-service

# Download Go module dependencies
go mod download

# Run the worker daemon
go run cmd/main.go
```
*You will see: `[Worker] Connected to Redis Streams. Listening for conversion jobs...`*

---

### 4. Frontend Web Client (Next.js)
The frontend provides the glassmorphic drag-and-drop UI, margin/orientation controls, real-time SSE progress tracking, and the in-browser WASM engine.

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Start Next.js development server
npm run dev
```
*Open your browser to `http://localhost:3001` (or your assigned Next.js dev port).*

## 🧪 Running Tests & Quality Checks

All contributions must pass automated tests and format checks before being merged. Run the following checks locally:

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint          # Run ESLint
npm run build         # Test Next.js production build dry-run
npm test              # Run component tests
```

### Backend API
```bash
cd backend-api
npx prisma validate   # Validate database schema
npm run lint          # Run ESLint
npm test              # Run unit & integration tests
```

### Worker Service (Go)
```bash
cd worker-service
gofmt -l .            # Ensure code formatting complies with gofmt
go vet ./...          # Run static code analysis
go test -v ./...      # Run test suite
```

- `refactor/worker-buffer-pool`

### Conventional Commit Standards
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This drives our automated enterprise release notes generator and changelog synchronization:

## 📐 Code Architecture & Style Guides

### TypeScript & Frontend (Next.js)
- Use standard functional React components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Avoid bulky external dependencies if native browser Canvas or CSS can accomplish the task.
- Keep components responsive and mobile-friendly with Tailwind CSS utilities.

### Go Worker Service
- Standard Go formatting (`gofmt`) is strictly enforced in CI.
- Always handle errors explicitly. Avoid swallowing errors or leaving blank `_` returns.
- Ensure goroutines are bounded with memory contexts and timeouts to prevent runaway goroutine leaks.

### Backend API & Database (NestJS + Prisma)
- Follow NestJS dependency injection and module patterns.
- Never write raw unescaped SQL queries; use Prisma Client methods to maintain safety against SQL injection.
- When modifying database tables, create clean migrations via `npx prisma migrate dev`.
